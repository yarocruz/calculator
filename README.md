Simple Web App Calculator

This was just a simple project I gave myself to start working with JavaScript. It's all onclick methods within the HTML page and the eval() function. I was surprised it was more simple than I imagined. Also used CSS Grid to layout the buttons. Loving CSS grid so much.

You can take a look at the demo [here](http://yaroskycruz.com/Calculator).
